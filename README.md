# National Black Reparations Map

The **FXB Centerâ€™s National Black Reparations Map** is an interactive tool that tracks the progress of reparation conversations, i.e., research, policy development, and enactment of reparations policy at the state, city, and local county level across the United States. Reparations for the African American community seek redress for slavery, redlining, mass incarceration, and other anti-black policies in the United States. Our research focuses on **Making the Health Case for Reparations**, and this map supports that work by tracking where reparations are being passed to address health disparities within the Black American community.

The [Black Reparations Directory](https://airtable.com/appVAaDUbHug6JBVT/shrc7vnOjje5jmgBF/tbl8TbJwwKKTqASZR) also accompanies the interactive map where you can find more information and links to the reparations work happening within state, city, and local governments.

This project was made possible through funding from the **Robert Wood Johnson Foundation**.
